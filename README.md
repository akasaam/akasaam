# Hello, World! 👋
I'm a web developer who loves to get my hands dirty with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also dabbled in Kotlin for some app development. 🚀

Currently, I'm wearing multiple hats at a startup called "Web Matter", juggling roles as a manager and CTO. It's a challenge, but I love it!

I'm always on the lookout for new tech to learn. When I'm not managing things or making tech decisions, you'll find me exploring new coding concepts. 💻

So, that's me! Feel free to explore my repos and let's code the future together!
